1. Love Calculator:
   calculates the percentage of love, by counting the number of t,r,u,e and l,o,v,e in the given names and merge them to get the percentage.
   
2. Habit Tracker:
   It is my python project that helps you keep track of any habit that you want to develop (here my project habit is basketball), using pixela. 
   Pixela is a web service that allows users to create and track custom graphs and charts. Users can input data points manually or via an API, and Pixela will generate a visual representation of the data over time. The service is commonly used for tracking personal habits, such as daily exercise or water intake, or for tracking business metrics like website traffic or social media engagement. Pixela is free to use, with paid plans available for additional features and data storage.
