#Python Projects
This repository contains fun Python projects:

1. Love Calculator
The Love Calculator is a simple Python program that calculates the percentage of love between two people. It works by counting the number of times the letters 't', 'r', 'u', 'e', 'l', 'o', 'v', and 'e' appear in the names of the two people. The program then combines these counts to generate a percentage of love between the two people.

2. Habit Tracker
The Habit Tracker is a Python project that helps you develop and maintain any habit you desire, using the Pixela web service. Pixela allows users to create and track custom graphs and charts to visually represent their progress over time. With the Habit Tracker, you can input data points manually or via an API, and Pixela will generate a visual representation of your progress. This project is particularly useful for tracking personal habits such as daily exercise or water intake, or for tracking business metrics such as website traffic or social media engagement. Pixela is free to use, with paid plans available for additional features and data storage.

The Habit Tracker in this repository is specifically designed to track the habit of playing basketball. However, the code can easily be modified to track any other habit you desire.
